## tidy_data.csv

This is tidy data obtained from running the script run_analysis.R

The data represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone

## run_analysis.R

The script will do the following:

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
